Polymorphic methods

Not allowed in Objective Caml
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "    ", fore "yellow"
class c = object method m x = x end
%fore "red"
Some type variables are unbound in this type:
  class c : object method m : 'a -> 'a end
The method m has type 'a -> 'a where 'a is unbound

%pause, font "sans", size 5, prefix " ", fore "white"
Need explicit annotation in O'Labl
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "    ", fore "yellow"
class c = object
    method m : 'a. 'a -> 'a = fun x -> x
end
%fore "lightpink"
class c : object method m : 'a -> 'a end
%fore "yellow"
let o = new c

Why GTK+ ?

Why use the GIMP Tool Kit?
%size 3

	Widely used in free software

	Easy to interface
		Written in C (QT uses C++)
		Memory management

Drawbacks
%size 3

	Design lacks uniformity
	Extensive use of dynamic typing

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

GTK+ Structure

Class hierarchy based on GtkObject
%size 2

	Single inheritance
&com1 New widgets may redefine methods
%size 2

	Dynamically checked
&com1 Casting necessay both up and down
%size 2

	Developper-side hierarchy
&com1 Inheritance is not always meaningful to the user
%size 2

%size 5
Signal-based callback mechanism
%size 2

	May use multiple callbacks
%size 2

	Signals are polymorphic

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

LablGTK structure

Typed at all levels

	Low-level interface
%size 2

		C stub functions -- typechecked by C

		ML type declarations -- ML abstract types

	High-level interface
%size 2

		ML class wrappers -- ML concrete types

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Low Level Interface

Goals

	Strongly typed interface
&com1 heavy use of advanced typing techniques

	Very little ML code
&com1 C-stubs and external declarations

	Safe memory management
&com1 have the library cooperate with the GC

Low level encoding (I)


How to represent widget subtyping in ML?

	Example: buttons' hierarchy
%size 2

%font "code", size 5, prefix "      ", fore "yellow"
GtkObject
    GtkWidget
        GtkContainer
            GtkButton
                GtkToggleButton
                    GtkRadioButton

Variants as set constraints


Variants can be seen as sets of possible values:

	[tag1 ... tagn] = {tag1,...,tagn}


Polymorphic variants introduce constraints

	α[> tag1 ... tagn] ⇔ α ⊃ {tag1,...,tagn}
	α[< tag1 ... tagn] ⇔ α ⊂ {tag1,...,tagn}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Encoding hierarchies

Define an abstract type
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      type 'a obj

&txt Use tags to represent properties
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      type t = [class1 ... classn] obj

&txt Functions check properties
&vspace
%font "code", fore "yellow", size 5
      val f : [> class1 ... classn] obj -> ...
&txt
	Subsumes Haskell type classes
&vspace
	Allows multiple inheritance

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Low level encoding (II)

Example: buttons' hierarchy
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "    ", fore "yellow"
type 'a obj
type widget = [widget] obj
type container = [widget container] obj
type button = [widget container button] obj
type toggle_button = [widget ... togglebutton] obj
type radio_button = [widget ... radiobutton] obj
type state_type = [ NORMAL
     ACTIVE PRELIGHT SELECTED INSENSITIVE ] 
val set_state : [> widget] obj -> state_type -> unit
val children : [> container] obj -> [widget] obj list
val clicked : [> button] obj -> unit
val set_group : [> radiobutton] obj -> group -> unit

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page
15
Alternate encoding

Use only standard ML features
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
type 'a obj
type 'a widget
...
type 'a radio
type state_type = NORMAL | ACTIVE | ... | INSENSITIVE
val set_state : 'a widget obj -> state_type -> unit
val children :
    'a container widget obj -> unit widget obj list
val clicked : 'a button container widget obj -> unit

&txt Weaknesses
	No multiple inheritance
	Not very intuitive for the user

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

Low level encoding (III)

Use of labeled parameters
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
val adjustment_new :
    value:float -> lower:float -> upper:float ->
    step_incr:float -> page_incr:float ->
    page_size:float -> adjustment obj

&txt Signals
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow", vgap 50
type ('a,'b) signal =
    { name: string; marshaller: 'b -> GtkArgv.t -> unit }
val connect : 'a obj -> sig:('a,'b) signal ->
               callback:'b -> ?after:bool -> id
val button_clicked : ([> button], unit -> unit) signal

High-Level Interface

Problems with GTK+
%size 2

	Name space is scattered
&com1 One has to know in which superclass a function is defined
	Developper oriented design
&com1 There is no clear distinction between public and private definitions

&txt LablGTK design
%size 2

	OCaml classes to reunify name space
	Omit developper-oriented methods

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

High-level classes

%font "code", size 4, prefix "  ", fore "yellow"
class button :
%fore "lightgreen"
  ?label:string ->
%fore "lightpink"
  ?border_width:int ->
  ?width:int ->
  ?height:int ->
%fore "lightgray"
  ?packing:(GButton.button -> unit) ->
  ?show:bool ->
%fore "yellow"
  object
%fore "lightgray"
    method destroy : unit -> unit
    method as_widget : Gtk.widget obj
    method misc : GObj.widget_misc

    method add : #is_widget -> unit
    method set_border_width : int -> unit
%fore "lightgreen"
    method clicked : unit -> unit
    method connect : GButton.button_signals
    method grab_default : unit -> unit

High-level features

	Objective Caml classes
&com1 allow collecting methods from different modules

	Use optionals in class constructors
&com1 makes widget creation much easier

	Polymorphic methods
&com1 needed for container widgets
%size 2

%font "code", size 4, fore "yellow", vgap 50
        method add : 'a. (#is_widget as 'a) -> unit

%fore "white", font "sans"
	Polymorphic variants
&com1 for C-style enumeration types, avoid name-space dependancies

Polymorphic methods (I)

	Instance of first-class polymorphism
%size 2

		first-class polytypes cannot be inferred
		they are propagated by the definition flow

	Technically
%size 2

		use polymorphism to track available information
		type system excludes derivations based on "guessed" information

First class polymorphism

%prefix " ", size 5, fore "lightblue"
  (σ1 : σ : σ2) ⇔ σ1 = θ(ρ1(σ)) ∧ σ2 = θ(ρ2(σ))
%fore "white"
where θ instantiates free variables, and ρ1,ρ2 rename free labels of σ.

Hello World

%font "code", size 4, prefix "    ", fore "yellow"
open GMain

let window =
    new GWindow.window border_width: 10

let button =
    new GButton.button
        label: "Hello World" packing: window#add

Conclusion

	Results
%size 2

		Could build a strongly typed interface

		It is easier to use than the C API

		Makes effective use of extensions to the type system

	Comments
%size 2

		Still difficulties with the Caml object system 
&com2 class recursion, method type refinement, etc...
