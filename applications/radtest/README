	Lablgtk RADTEST

Author: Hubert Fauque, hubert.fauque@inria.fr

This is an experimental R.A.D. for Lablgtk.
You can compile it simply by make.


When radtest starts a new empty project is open;
you can add new windows to this project by clicking on
the window icon at the top of the icons window;

by clicking on an item in the tree window with the third button
you can add or remove widgets;
you can also drag widgets from the icons window and drop them
on the tree;

when a widget is selected (click on it in the tree) you can
move it up or down (if its parent is a box) with CTRL-up_arrow
or CTRL-down_arrow; with up_arrow and down_arrow you select
the widget which is above or below the currently selected widget;

Save the project by Project->Save, and load an already existing
project by Project->Open.
