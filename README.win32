        Here is a small howto about installing LablGtk2 on Win32

Binary installation

The binary distribution includes the lablglade and lablrsvg libraries.

0) Both MSVC and mingw versions of ocaml 3.09 or 3.10 should work.

1) Install the gtk2 libraries and dependencies. You can use the installer from the
   "Glade for Windows" project on Sourceforge.
     http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules/news/
   The runtime environment is sufficient for bytecode, but you will need the developper
   version if you want to link with ocamlopt.
   Tests were done with Gtk+ 2.10.11, but ulterior versions should work too.

2) Install lablgtk2 binaries and scripts inside the OCaml distribution
     bin/lablgtk2.bat             -> bin
     lib/stublibs/dlllablgtk2.dll -> lib/stublibs
     lib/lablgtk2                 -> lib/lablgtk2

3) Go to the lib/lablgtk2 directory and execute
        ocaml build.ml
   This will compile the ocaml part of the library (the C part is
   already compiled.)
   It may fail on the native code version (using ocamlopt) if the
   assembler is not on your path.  Look in the Objective Caml windows
   documentation for what is needed, and check that you have a working
   installation by compiling and linking a trivial program.
   Note also that the autodection for mingw is not fool-proof
   (lablgtk2 has to be installed directly under the ocaml library), so
   if the OCaml port annouced by build.ml is not the right one, you
   should specify it by hand inside build.ml.

   You must repeat this compilation step every time you upgrade OCaml.

4) Test in examples
     lablgtk2.bat testgtk.ml

   See also the "Windows port" section of the main LablGtk2 README for
   important remarks on threads on Windows.

5) For custom linking or native code, you need to use the export
   libraries in the above DLL package. There is not default place to
   put them, so you should specify that at link time:
     ocamlopt -ccopt "/link /libpath:/home/garrigue/gtk-2.6.8/lib"
       -I +lablgtk2 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx testgtk.ml -o testgtk.exe
   or, on Mingw
     ocamlopt -ccopt "-L/home/garrigue/gtk-2.6.8/lib" -I +lablgtk2 \
        lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx testgtk.ml -o testgtk.exe
   Again, if this fails you must make sure that your ocamlopt really works,
   and that all paths are correctly specified.


Full compilation (for the brave)

0) You will need either the MSVC or mingw version of ocaml 3.07 or more,
and cygwin development tools. If you use mingw, check your 
installation by trying to compile a hello world C program with
    gcc -mno-cygwin  -mms-bitfields main.c
 
1) Install Gtk 2: use the precompiled binaries available at 

     http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules/news/

  This time you need the developper version.
  Do NOT even try to compile it yourself from scratch.

  Try to compile a small hello-gtk.c (see the tutorial page on 
  http://www.gtk.org) before going further.

3) If you are using mingw, "./configure" should succeed. (Well not for me...)
  For MSVC, copy config.make.nt to config.make, and edit it to set GTKROOT.

4) Simply do "make" and "make opt" for the native version.

5) Install ("make install") and test.
