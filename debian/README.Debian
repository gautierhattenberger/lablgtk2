lablgtk2 for Debian
-------------------

 This package contains gtk2 bindings for ocaml. It is still heavily under
 developpment (thus the alpha status in the version) and not as mature as the
 lablgtk package, which contains binding for gtk1.2.

 Please use this package at your own risk, and prefer the older lablgtk if you
 wish stability (note, the upstream README file has more details).
